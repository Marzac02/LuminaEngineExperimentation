## About

Lumina is a modern C++ game engine designed for learning and experimentation with real-world engine architecture. Built from the ground up with Vulkan, it demonstrates professional engine design patterns including reflection systems, ECS architecture, and advanced rendering techniques.

**Perfect for:**
- Learning modern game engine architecture
- Experimenting with Vulkan rendering techniques
- Building prototypes with a clean, modular codebase
- Understanding how engines like Unreal and Godot work under the hood

> **Note:** Lumina is an educational project in active development. APIs may change, and some features are experimental. If you encounter build issues, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xQSB7CRzQE) for assistance.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Visual Studio** (MSVC 17.8+)
- **Python 3.8+** (automatically installed if missing)
- **Vulkan SDK**  ([Download](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home))

### Installation

Lumina's installation is being worked on, at the moment a majority of it's steps are compiled down into just running Setup.py.
However I've noticed some issues with UTF-8 chars on Window's terminals, if the terminal opens and closes quickly, keep trying.

During the setup process, Lumina will attempt to download from Dropbox, if for some reason this fails. You can get the .7z file here, and extract it yourself into the engine install directory
https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/suigjbqj75pzcpxcqm6hv/External.7z?rlkey=ebu8kiw4gswtvj5mclg6wa1lu&st=759m2aj0&dl=0

```

** Ensure you have all prerequisites installed **

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mrdrelliot/lumina.git
cd lumina

# 2. Run setup (downloads dependencies automatically)
python Setup.py

# 3. Build and run the Editor
Set Editor as startup project → Build → Run (Prefer Development configuration)

# 4. Select a project
Open the Sandbox project to play around
or..
Open Tools/ProjectConfigurator.py to create a new project.

Happy coding!
```

### First Time Setup

After building, the `LUMINA_DIR` environment variable should be automatically set. If not:
```bash
setx LUMINA_DIR "C:\path\to\lumina"
```

## 📖 Documentation

### Coding Standards

Lumina follows a consistent naming convention:

| Prefix | Usage | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `F` | Internal engine types (non-reflected) | `FRenderer`, `FTexture` |
| `C` | Reflected classes | `CTransform`, `CMeshRenderer` |
| `S` | Reflected structs | `SVertex`, `SMaterial` |

**General Rules:**
- ✅ PascalCase for all identifiers
- ✅ Tabs for indentation
- ✅ Braces on new lines
- ✅ Descriptive variable names

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete guidelines.

### Architecture Overview

```
Game Loop → ECS Update → Render Graph → Vulkan Commands → Present
              ↓              ↓              ↓
          Reflection    Scene Graph    Resource Manager
```
