## About
Lumina is a modern C++ game engine designed for learning and experimentation with real-world engine architecture. Built from the ground up with Vulkan, it demonstrates professional engine design patterns including reflection systems, ECS architecture, and advanced rendering techniques.

**Perfect for:**
- Learning modern game engine architecture
- Experimenting with Vulkan rendering techniques
- Building prototypes with a clean, modular codebase
- Understanding how engines like Unreal and Godot work under the hood

> [!CAUTION]
> Lumina is an educational project in active development. APIs may change, and some features are experimental. If you encounter build issues, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xQSB7CRzQE) for assistance.

## Quick Start

### What You Need
- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)
- **Visual Studio 2022 or 2019** with MSVC v143 toolset (17.8+)
- **Python 3.8+** added to your system PATH


> [!NOTE]
> [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) is the recommended IDE for Lumina development (but it is not required) 

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mrdrelliot/luminaengine
   cd LuminaEngine
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   python Setup.py
   ```
   - This downloads and extracts all dependencies automatically
   - If the download fails, manually download [External.7z](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/suigjbqj75pzcpxcqm6hv/External.7z?rlkey=ebu8kiw4gswtvj5mclg6wa1lu&st=68ybsxy2&dl=0) and extract it to the `LuminaEngine` folder

3. **Open the solution**
   - Open `Lumina.sln` in Visual Studio

4. **Build and run Lumina**
   - Select "Lumina" in the list of runnable configurations
   - Select `Development` or `Debug` configuration (Debug will be vastly slower, but with debugger functionality)
   - **Note** You will see two different platforms, `Game` and `Editor`, by default this will be set to `Editor`. Selecting game will launch without any tooling.
   - Press F5 or click Build -> Run

6. **Start developing**
   - Open the `Sandbox` project to experiment
   - (TEMPORARILY NOT-WORKING) Or run `Tools/ProjectConfigurator.py` to create a new project

> [!TIP]
>  **Missing v143 toolset?** Install it via Visual Studio Installer -> Individual Components -> MSVC v143 Build Tools
> **"Cannot find .generated.h" error?** Build again - Visual Studio sometimes needs a second pass to detect new files
> **Python not found?** Ensure Python is added to PATH during installation (check "Add Python to PATH" when installing)
> **Error C1076 compiler limit: internal heap limit reached** - Try again, this is currently an issue with a font file.
> **Build fails?** [Submit an issue](https://github.com/mrdrelliot/LuminaEngine/issues) or contact me on Discord

> [!NOTE]
> The `LUMINA_DIR` environment variable is set automatically during build. If needed, set it manually:
```bash
setx LUMINA_DIR "C:\path\to\lumina"
```

## Documentation

### Coding Standards

Lumina follows a consistent naming convention:

| Prefix | Usage | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `F` | Internal engine types (non-reflected) | `FRenderer`, `FTexture` |
| `C` | Reflected classes | `CTransform`, `CMeshRenderer` |
| `S` | Reflected structs | `SVertex`, `SMaterial` |

**General Rules:**
- PascalCase for all identifiers
- Tabs for indentation
- Braces on new lines
- Descriptive variable names

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for complete guidelines.
